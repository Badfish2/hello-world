# hello-world
My first repository!
Hello! My name is Richard Pinegar however I like to be called Pin. 
I am 30 years old and brand new in the programming world.  I am 
currently a student at NSCC in MA, going for my Computer Science 
degree.  I am really looking forward to becoming proficient at 
software development, app development, and mainly Java at the moment.
I currently practice programming on every one of my breaks at work and 
mostly late at night.
